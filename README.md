# DNSSpoofing

We tried to create a DNSSpoofer using Scapy in Python that instead of taking any targeted user to legitimate facebook.com redirects user to our fake page that looks exactly like facebook. From there on 
we can steal user's facebook username and password.

##In order to run the project :

Go to the porject directory and run  "python DNSSpoofing.py"
